            <p>The Mechanical Engineering Department was one of the First Departments to be started in this Institution in 1980. 
                The Department offers UG, PG, MSc Engineering (By Research) and Ph.D. programmes. 
                The Department was Accredited for 03 years by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in the year 2004 and for 05 years in the year 2007.
                 The department has bagged 01 UG university rank and 10 PG ranks. The Mechanical Engineering Association was started in the year 1995. 
                 It has well established Departmental Library since 1996 and has adequate number of useful books. 
                 The university has recognized the department as Research Centre for awarding Ph.D. and M.Sc. Engg.
                 by research. A total number of 24 research scholars are undergoing Ph.D. programme in the Research Centre. 
                 The Department received Rs 11.5/- lakhs grant from AICTE towards “Modernization of Design Laboratory” during the year 2013. 
                 Rs. 15.5 Lakhs have been sanctioned by AICTE for carrying out R & D Projects at our R & D Centre during 2012-2014. 
                 Also the department is conducting Workshops, Seminars, Faculty development programs for the benefits of students, Research Scholar and faculty members.</p>
